# jquery-tree-table

For complete documentation, see [wiki](https://github.com/mbools/jquery-tree-table/wiki)


Data driven JQuery plugin for table layout with one column (optionally) nominated for display as a tree

Create table as normal. Header cells can be marked with column controls, each row with row controls.

See API for methods to control jquery-tree-table programatically.

If the table is identified as `active` then a DOM observer is used to ensure constraints (see below) are maintained
even as the table's content is changed.
